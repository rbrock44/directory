## ðŸ§  What's My Purpose?

This is a server side single-page angular frontend created to host links and descriptions to the other software creations I've made. It was inspired by zuul - which is a backend directory for microservice management

- Framework: `Angular 18`
- Testing: `Karma`
- Deployment: `GitHub Pages`
